Data Description Web Crawling and Analysis for Restaurant Chain 
This project consisted linear regression and time series models by crawling Yelp ratings and reviews for the restaurant chain Tacombi. The web scraping was written in python through Jupyter Notebook, and visualization through Tableau. The flagship location, Nolita, had 3x more reviews with a 3.5 star rating than the rest of the locations. Bleeker street was used as a location of comparison, which represented the median rating and reviews for the other locations. The 2 locations were compared with a distribution and count of ratings, a time series analysis with a linear regression of the average rating, a time series analysis of amount and average ratings and a count/distinct count of users who rated per year. In conclusion, there wasnâ€™t much of a difference in average rating, so every review really counts. The service was often complained about at Nolita, which leads to the lower reviews. 
The Jupyter Notebook files consist of the yelp crawling for each location. The python file includes some regression analysis (rest done in Tableau). The word document includes details of the report, along with pictures of graphed analysis.
